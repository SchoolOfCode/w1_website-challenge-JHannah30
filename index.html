            <div>
                <p>
                    I currently work for the council, within the environmental department. 
                    My role is interesting and has been great for developing problem solving and interpersonal skills. 
                    The down side is that it can be super stressful at times (a lot of being screamed at whilst trying to help people).
                    Before this, I held a job as a software development recruitment consultant, which was great. 
                    I loved learning about different languages and the projects that people were working on, which has ultimately inspired me to change careers into tech.

                    <h4>Previous experience with web development</h4>
                    <p>
                        I tried to self-teach software development, but like many other people, found it difficult to manage whilst working a full-time job. 
                        It was difficult to consistently set time aside to learn, and with no clear direction, became increasingly hard to motivate myself to learn.

                    <p>
                        I'm a huge fan of documentaries, particularly those with David Attenborough type vibes!
                        Being active and spending time in the outdoors is really important to me, not to mention it's a great way to recharge away from work.
                        Other hobbies include journaling, building computers, taking amateur looking photos and playing video games - although I dont get much time to play those anymore!

                    <h2>A project of mine</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another hobby of mine is small space conversions and renovations. I've recently bought a van with my partner who lives in the Netherlands, so we can work on a project of our own.

                    <p>
                        Our plan is to strip the van and rebuild it into a modern camper van. I'm pretty excited about the idea of driving around the continent, being able to develop websites from wherever we've decided to park the van for the week.
